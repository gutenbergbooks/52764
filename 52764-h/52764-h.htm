<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Scene I.</span>—<i>Two rooms right and left, stage divided in the
centre; a door of communication between rooms, fastened by
a bolt on either side; small tables, sofas, and arm-chairs.

<p class='c003'><i>Pri.</i> (<i>advancing towards table</i>). Beg pardon, sir.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> (<i>lazily</i>). All right.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Pri.</i> Beg pardon, sir, exceedingly sorry to disturb you;
(<i>to</i> <span class='sc'>Waiter</span>) he’s asleep.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> (<i>snores</i>).</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Pri.</i> (<i>loudly</i>). I’m really very sorry to wake you, sir.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> (<i>still lying on sofa</i>). What! you don’t mean to say
it’s twelve.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Pri.</i> Twelve! ah, to be sure, the hour I was to wake him
for the ball.  No, sir, it’s only ten o’clock; but (<i>looking at
him</i>) he’s asleep again—the devil! (<i>Calling loudly.</i>) I’m
really pained to awake you, sir—</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> (<i>half rising and yawning</i>). What on earth’s the
matter? Oh, it’s you, Mr. Red Lion, is it?</p>

<div class='c007'>[<i>Sinks back.</i></div>
<p class='c011'><i>Pri.</i> Beg pardon, sir, I am not Red Lion: it is my neighbor
of the next hotel I suppose you allude to. Here, sir,
you are in the first and best hotel in the town,—the White
Horse.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> (<i>stretching himself on sofa</i>). All right, with all my
heart, then, Mr. White Horse. What is it?</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Pri.</i> Well, sir, the fact is, I’m in a dreadful fix—a most
awkward predicament, out of which I cannot extricate myself
without your assistance. You see, sir, if you will only pardon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>it, but my daughter was only married to-day. Yes, sir,
married; in fact, sir, she was married to make her happy—you
know, sir,—you understand! And, sir, just as we are
having a little dance in honor of this marriage, which takes
up all our spare accommodation, a lady and her maid arrive,
asking for rooms; and, as they require two beds in one room,
I dared to hope that perhaps, sir, you would oblige me by
changing this room for the next one. You see, sir, that the
bedroom belonging to this sitting-room has two beds, whilst
in here (<i>throwing open door in centre partition</i>) there is only
one bed, though in all respects furnished in the same manner.
If you, sir, would oblige me by just looking in (<i>on turning to</i>
<span class='sc'>Charles</span>, <i>finds him asleep</i>)—Confound it, he’s asleep again!
(<i>To audience.</i>) An idea occurs to me; (<i>turning to</i> <span class='sc'>Waiter</span>)
here, George, catch hold of one end of this sofa. (<i>They
take sofa, and carry it into next room with</i> <span class='sc'>Charles</span> <i>asleep
on it</i>.) There, I don’t believe he’ll find it out; here, George,
his luggage. (<i>Brings baggage, but leaves letter.</i>) There, now,
that’s all right, and now (<i>entering next door, and closing with
bolt</i>) I can fetch the ladies up.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Luc.</i> Many thanks. Don’t forget the horses at six o’clock
to-morrow morning.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Pri.</i> To the moment, madam. (<i>Aside to</i> <span class='sc'>Elizabeth</span>, <i>who
has re-entered</i>.) If you can find time, join us downstairs.
Don’t forget; I shall expect you.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Eliz.</i> All right; as soon as missus has done with me.</p>

<div class='c007'>[<i>Exit</i> <span class='sc'>Pri.</span></div>
<p class='c011'><i>Cha.</i> (<span class='fss'>R. H.</span>, <i>waking up</i>). Hullo! there’s somebody talking
in the next room.</p>

<div class='c007'>[<i>Listens, sitting up.</i></div>
<p class='c011'><i>Luc.</i> You seem to know the landlord, Elizabeth?</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Eliz.</i> Oh, yes, ma’am, I’ve known him for some time:
his wife was a friend of mine, and his daughter that married
to-day is my godchild.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> Indeed! Then I suppose you’d like to join them
downstairs. You can go, and I’ll open my things myself.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Eliz.</i> Oh, thank you, mum!</p>

</div>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> (<i>sitting on side of sofa</i>, <span class='fss'>R. H.</span>). By Jove! one hears
every thing that is going on next door. Seems to be a lady
and her maid—not very gentlemanly to listen, Master
Charley, but it’s interesting. Ah, well! when I was young
this might have led to an adventure. I should never have
rested until I had made the acquaintance of my fair neighbor,—for
I suppose she is fair,—whilst now there’s not the
slightest danger. Confound it! I must see this woman,
though. (<i>Rising, and going towards door.</i>) Hullo! I could
have sworn the lock of the door was on the other side just
now. That’s deuced funny. (<i>Looking round the room.</i>)
Why, where the mischief am I? and how on earth did I get
here?</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> (<i>looking at her watch</i>). Half-past ten.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> Ah! I understand. I thought I had a terrible nightmare.
A frightful monster held me by the feet, and another
by the head; it appears, however, that these monsters must
have been the Red Lion or the White Horse, and my room
has been given to this lady, whoever she may be, to suit
their convenience. Well, I don’t care very much about seeing
her. All women are alike—just as cats are all alike.
(<i>Stoops down to examine the door.</i>) Why, there’s no lock!
only a bolt. Well, I can’t help that; let’s see if we can’t
get another nap until it’s time to go to the ball.</p>

<div class='c007'>[<i>Returns to sofa.</i></div>
<p class='c011'><i>Luc.</i> (<i>book in hand, seated on sofa</i>). This “Voyage round
the World” is always a charming book to read.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>She puts her book upon the table, and leans her head
upon her arm as if to read book; perceives
letter.</i></p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> Why, here’s somebody’s letter! (<i>Takes it up, coming
down front.</i>) Not very ladylike to read it, I suppose; but
all women are curious. Seems to be unfinished. Of course
it’s very wrong to read this letter (<i>reads</i>),—</p>

<p class='c014'>“<span class='sc'>My dear George</span>,—As I quite anticipated on my
return from home, the Government appointment I expected
has been given to another. Pardon me, if on
receiving this intelligence, I quitted London without
bidding you adieu—and as it seems”—</p>

<p class='c003'>This is really too bad of me,—</p>

<p class='c015'>“that I am too lazy to do any thing, as you all of you
always said”—</p>

<div class='c007'>[<i>Pausing.</i></div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>What on earth does that mean? I should much like to see
the author (<i>reading again from letter</i>),—</p>

<p class='c015'>“I intend as soon as I have realized what property I have,
to go to Baden, and once more try my luck at the tables.
If I win, I shall found a hospital; and if I lose—well, in
that case, the only thing I can see for me to do is to
join my mother.”</p>

<div class='c007'>[<i>Finishing reading letter.</i></div>
<p class='c011'>That’s all; this gentleman has got no further, or else he has
taken away the end of it.</p>

<div class='c007'>[<i>Commences re-reading in a low tone.</i></div>
<p class='c011'><i>Cha.</i> (<i>rousing himself</i>). Oh! I can’t lay here any longer.
Morpheus won’t come to my aid. What shall I do? Well,
I might just as well finish my letter to George. Why! what
the deuce have I done with it? (<i>Searches in his pockets.</i>)
Why, it seems to me I left it on the table before I went to
sleep.</p>

<div class='c007'>[<i>He looks upon the table.</i></div>
<p class='c011'><i>Luc.</i> (<i>again reading letter</i>). “In that case, the only thing
I can see for me to do is to join my mother.”</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> (<i>striking his forehead</i>). Confound it! I’ve left it
in the next room.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> (<i>putting down letter, and taking up book</i>). After all,
I’m not George, and I’ve no right to read that letter.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> But then my letter must be in the power of this
woman. It appears to me that I’ve a perfect right to—</p>

<div class='c007'>[<i>Knocks gently at door.</i></div>
<p class='c011'><i>Luc.</i> Good gracious! there’s some one knocking. Who is
there? What do you want?</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> A thousand pardons, madam. I am the person who
inhabited a few minutes ago the room you now occupy; and
by accident in leaving the room I left an unfinished letter.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> (<i>aside</i>). Dear me! This is the young gentleman
that’s too lazy for any thing.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> Would you be kind enough to return me my letter?</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> (<i>embarrassed</i>). Sir, I’ll ring in order that your letter
may be brought to you.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> A thousand pardons, madam; but pray don’t trouble
to ring. Can’t you slip it under the door?</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> Oh, certainly! There it is.</p>

<div class='c007'>[<i>Passes letter.</i></div>
<p class='c011'><i>Cha.</i> Thanks. (<i>Aside.</i>) A charming voice,—soft as a
bird’s; and, if the plumage only corresponds—(<i>He goes to
examine fastening.</i>) Confound this bolt! Infamous hotel!
(<i>He returns to table, and prepares to write.</i>) By the way, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>should like to know if she’s read this (<i>looking at letter</i>).
Well, there’s a very old method for ascertaining that: ask
her. (<i>Goes to door, and knocks.</i>) Madam, pardon me—</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> What do you want, sir?</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> Madam, my letter was left open on the table; and
in taking it up—without, of course, the slightest desire—your
eye must naturally have fallen upon it, and—</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> (<i>aside</i>). I understand. (<i>Aloud.</i>) I don’t understand
you, sir; and, inasmuch as I’ve done what you desire, I
must beg that we have no further conversation, as I shall
refuse to answer.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> Why, may I ask? I was asleep just now, and
dreaming charmingly. If you like, I’ll tell you the dream.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> Certainly not, sir.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> Very good: it’ll keep for another time; but then,
inasmuch as it was you that woke me up, permit me at least
to converse with you as a compensation.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> (<i>aside</i>). He is not stupid.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> I beg pardon: did you speak?</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> (<i>aside</i>). What have I to dread? He seems a gentleman.
(<i>Aloud.</i>) Well, sir, proceed, as you consider yourself
aggrieved; only remember that I trust to your feelings as a
gentleman, and your discretion.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> Madam, you may depend upon it. (<i>Wheeling arm-chair
to door, and speaking through keyhole.</i>) Are you
married?</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> (<i>affronted and aside</i>). Upon my word! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Do
you call that discretion, sir?</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> Most certainly; as a subject of conversation I see
nothing against it. Society prescribes certain forms of conversation;
and, to ascertain what forms to use, one must
know whether one is speaking to a widow or a young girl,
to an old maid or a married woman.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> In—I—I am married.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> (<i>aside</i>). So much the worse. I, madam, am a
bachelor, and I’m going to Baden. Where may you be
going?</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> A long way off, sir.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> To—</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> To rejoin my husband, naturally.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> By the way, madam, do you love your husband?</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> Excuse me, sir, but, if you don’t mind, we’ll change
the conversation.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span><i>Cha.</i> Whatever pleases you, madam, pleases me. (<i>Pause.</i>)
A charming hotel, madam, is this Golden Lion. So well
furnished, so well decorated! My goodness me! it gives
me the inclination to set fire to the place.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> If you’ve any such intentions, sir, pray remember
that I’m in the hotel.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> Very good; only just remember, that, in not setting
fire to the hotel, I’m saving your life. (<i>A pause.</i>) By the
way, madam, now I come to think of it, you do not love your
husband.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> Sir!</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> When one is compelled to separate one’s self from
a husband that one loves, one is not so light-hearted as you
were just now, and—</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> Really, sir!</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> Madam, pardon me, but you do not evidently possess
a husband who would make you cry out in the words of
Sterne, “Oh, Love, king of gods and men!” Now, if it had
been my fate to have crossed your path, I swear that—</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> And I swear to you, sir, that I would never marry a
man who was too lazy to do any thing.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> Madam, you have read my letter.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> I, sir? oh, dear, no! I can assure you I only looked
at it. By the way, would you mind informing me how it is
that you came to inhabit this room?</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> Well, the fact is, I went to sleep on the sofa: I’ve
some faint recollection of the landlord coming in and asking
me something about moving out; but he was so long about
it that I fell asleep again, and during that time I fancy he
had me quietly carried, sofa and all, into the next room. By
the way, I have a charming idea.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> May I venture to ask it? (<i>Aside.</i>) I should like to
have a look at this man.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> Madam, in the East, you are aware that a veil is a
protecting wall between man and woman. If you would
endeavor to put on such a veil, and would do me the honor
of granting me an interview,—the landlord can supply us
with refreshments,—we can converse more easily than
through this partition; in fact, we shall be in the East; and,
further, I pledge myself on my honor as a gentleman, that
nothing shall in any way cause you to regret our interview.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span><i>Luc.</i> (<i>aside</i>). His letter announces that he intends to risk
his fortune. What if I could dissuade him? it would at
least be the act of a Christian, and—and a woman.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> What! not a word? must I then beseech you in
song?—</p>

<p class='c016'>(<i>Sings.</i>)</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> I consent, but upon one condition; and that is,
that you explain to me how it is that a man can be too lazy
to do any thing.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> Very good; at least I will explain to you the meaning
of this somewhat bad joke.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> Sir, upon these conditions in a few moments I shall
be prepared to meet you—in China.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> Madam, in a few minutes I shall have the honor of
presenting myself. (<i>Goes to window, calling.</i>) Mr. Red
Lion, or Mr. White Horse!</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> (<i>aside</i>). I suppose I’d better alter my dress a little
for the occasion.</p>

<div class='c007'>[<i>Exit</i> <span class='fss'>L. 1 E.</span></div>
<p class='c011'><i>Cha.</i> (<i>coming down stage</i>). He has absolutely condescended
to hear me,—this landlord. Upon my word, I’m
rather pleased with this little adventure; if I’d gone to the
ball, at any rate, I should never have heard so sweet a voice.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c003'><i>Pri.</i> For nobody else but you, sir, would I have disturbed
myself upon the auspicious occasion. To-day! yesterday!
did I tell you that my daughter was married? Yes, sir, to
make—</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> You couldn’t do better, my dear White Horse, if
you intended giving your daughter a husband. Just listen
to me for a moment; you will oblige me by going up—yourself,
mind—into that lady’s room next door.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Pri.</i> Marrying one’s daughter, sir, when one is a father,
is a grave responsibility; my emotions—</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> Of course you feel as a father; you will be good
enough to take up plenty of candles, some flowers—</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Pri.</i> So long as she’s happy, so long as—(<span class='sc'>Charles</span>,
<i>movement of impatience</i>)—candles, sir, yes, sir, and flowers;
yes, sir.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> Afterwards you will bring up some refreshments;
tea, for instance.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span><i>Pri.</i> Tea, sir?</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> Yes; tea, tea, tea.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> Not in the least, thanks. (<i>Going, Charles stops him.</i>)
Ah, by the way, landlord, that lady in the next room—what
sort of a person is she?</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Pri.</i> Char—ming, sir; be-a-u-ti-ful. Oh! she’s much
handsomer than her father; but if hereafter he should
betray her, if he should—</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> Who the devil are you talking about?</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Pri.</i> My shon-in-law.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> Confound your son-in-law!</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Pri.</i> Yes, sir, certainly, sir: that’s what I say, and—</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> Be off, and do what I told you.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Pri.</i> Yes, sir, directly; but you’ll understand that on
such an auspicious—</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> There, there—be off; Red Lion—he’s gone.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Cha.</i> (<i>alone</i>). I suppose he’ll do what I’ve told him. I
ought to change my coat too. Upon my honor (<i>dressing

another, oddly enough, I feel quite curious to see this
woman; in fact, I begin to be interested. It’s so long since
I’ve been in the least interested—yes, it’s six months since
any thing of the kind has happened. And my heart is, after
all, but human: it detests a void.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Pri.</i> Eh, my daughter, madam; at this moment she’s so
happy—may she be so all her life! and as to your maid,
madam, she dances as if my daughter’s happiness depended
on her legs, you understand. Madam, of course I mean—</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> Perfectly; be good enough to open that door, and
show the gentleman in, who is in there.</p>

<div class='c007'>[<i>Sits down, and puts on veil.</i></div>
<p class='c011'><i>Pri.</i> But, madam—</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> Do what I tell you.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Pri.</i> (<i>hesitating, yet opens door of communication, and
enters</i> <span class='sc'>Charles’s</span> <i>room</i>). Sir!</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> All right, I’ve heard; you can announce me.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Pri.</i> You wrote your name in my book; but you see,
sir, my daughter’s—</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> You’ve forgotten it; say Mr. Charleston King.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Pri.</i> (<i>re-entering</i> <span class='fss'>L. H.</span>). Mr. Charles, son of a king!</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> Son of a king!</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> (<i>entering</i>). Charleston King, at your service, madam.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Pri.</i> (<i>aside, going</i>). A veiled woman in my house on
such a day!</p>

<div class='c007'>[<i>Exit.</i></div>
<p class='c011'><i>Cha.</i> (<i>taking a chair near</i> <span class='sc'>Lucy</span>). It is really too good
of you, madam, to receive a man in your rooms who you
never saw; and I scarcely know how to thank you.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> You will thank me, sir, by explaining how it is that
one can be—</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> Too lazy for any thing.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> Precisely. If you will take the chair near you, you
can be seated.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> Well, you see, in this world men have all sorts of
faces. (<span class='sc'>Prichard</span> <i>enters with tea-tray</i>.) Confound this
fellow! Just as I was getting on so nicely!</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Pri.</i> (<i>putting down tea</i>). Madam—</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> Talking of faces, let me draw your attention, madam,
to this one (<i>pointing to</i> <span class='sc'>Pri.’s</span> <i>face</i>). There is a face that has
committed faults—crimes.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Pri.</i> Crimes! Faults! Me, madam! me, sir! Here is
the best tea, which upon this auspicious day—</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span><i>Cha.</i> That’ll do.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Pri.</i> Crimes! Faults! Yes, madam, your maid has
charmed us to such an extent with her dancing on this
auspicious—</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> (<i>taking no notice of</i> <span class='sc'>Pri.</span>). Go on talking, sir, whilst
I pour out the tea.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> Well, madam, in consequence of my misfortune my
lifetime has indeed been a miserable one,—sorrow upon
sorrow, faults accumulating upon faults.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Pri.</i> (<i>leaving</i>). Crimes! Faults, indeed!</p>

<div class='c007'>[<i>Exit.</i></div>
<p class='c011'><i>Cha.</i> My friends always insisted on declaring that I was
too lazy to do any thing; and the unlucky star that I was
born under, gossiping tongues, and certain circumstances
all combined, seemed to favor such a prediction.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> But, sir, was this merited? (<i>Making tea.</i>) Will
you have a cup of tea, Mr.—Mr.—</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> (<i>absorbed</i>). Apollo.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> Mr. Apollo.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> Madam! Ah, a thousand pardons. I was absorbed
in thinking of my miserable self.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> (<i>getting interested</i>). Have you no relations?</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> I had an uncle, a well-known merchant, but he died
two years ago.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> And didn’t he leave any thing?</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> Oh, dear, yes; he left a very nice fortune. In fact,
he adopted this young lady on purpose to do that.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> Oh, that wasn’t right.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> I don’t know that it’s wrong; but it is not on
account of this that I owe him a grudge. I heard that the
only way in which he could discharge an obligation to a
friend of his was by adopting this friend’s daughter, who was
left an orphan, a very charming person, I heard; at least, so
I was told, for I refused to put my foot inside his house.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> Curious determination!</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> Pardon me: not at all. The fact is, he insulted
me,—he made me a present.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> A present! what could it be?</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> “<i>A very handsome dressing-case</i>” (<i>a waltz is heard
playing outside</i>), with my name engraved upon it, and below
my name the following compliment: “Too lazy to do any
thing.” I was furious, but I wanted a dressing-case: so,
as I wanted a dressing-case, I kept it. I’ll trouble you for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>another cup of tea, at least if you don’t find me too lazy for
that?</p>

<div class='c007'>[<i>Handing cup.</i></div>
<p class='c011'><i>Luc.</i> With pleasure.</p>

<div class='c007'>[<i>Hands cup.</i></div>
<p class='c011'><i>Cha.</i> Thanks; don’t let’s talk of my unfortunate self any
more; a little more sugar, please.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> This country band really plays that waltz charmingly.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> (<i>listening and pondering</i>). Yes, oh, yes; how often
have I heard that air, and how happy have I been!</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> That waltz?</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> My mother used to play it to me when <i>I was a little
child</i>!</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> Have you any control over yourself?</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> Most certainly, a good deal even; ask me to prove
it.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> You would not grant what I ask.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> I wouldn’t. Ah, madam! you want to send me
away.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> Not at all: only I wished to explain to you, that,
never having worn a thick veil in a room, I’m simply stifling.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> I can quite believe you. Nothing, nothing is so
dangerous as a thick veil: you must take it off at once,—you
must.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> If you can sufficiently control yourself to sit in a
chair here without turning your head, I will sit behind you,
and we can finish our conversation without my being stifled.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> (<i>reproachfully</i>). What, madam!</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> Well, you must choose; for, as I don’t want to die
of suffocation, I shall be forced to give you your <i>congé</i>.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> (<i>taking chair down front of scene, and sitting</i>).
Madam, this is the second time it is my good fortune to
save your life to-night, in return for which—</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> (<i>advancing with a cup of tea in one hand, whilst with
the other she keeps him down in the chair</i>). Then, sir, I am
to understand that, notwithstanding all the misfortunes connected
with your nickname, you have still hope.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> Yes,—hope, that poor little creature that nothing
can kill.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> It is, then, this hope that takes you to Baden?</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> Baden is, as far as I’m concerned at this moment,
my last hope in this world; then, if my luck is once more
against me, if fortune fails to help me, if that poor little
creature, hope, succumbs to bad luck, why, then—</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span><i>Luc.</i> You’ll go and join your mother.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> Yes, madam, I shall go.</p>

<div class='c007'>[<i>Endeavoring to turn round.</i></div>
<p class='c011'><i>Luc.</i> If you do that, I shall have to tie you with my handkerchief.
Don’t you think now, joking apart, that it would
be wiser, without tempting fortune at Baden, to go to your
“mother at once”? (<i>Waltz music again.</i>) She’d play to
you again. (<i>Listening.</i>) Come, do you hear that waltz? and
when you hear it once more by her side,—that dear mother,—you’ll
be happy, and—</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> Ah! then, in reading my letter, you evidently did
not understand, did not comprehend.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> Comprehend what?</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> The country that my mother is gone to.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> No.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> It is the Country of Peace, of Repose,—the only
land from which the mother cannot return to console her
child.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> (<i>making a movement as if to show herself</i>). Then,
sir, am I to understand that if you lost—you would—(<i>stops,
and reseats herself</i>)—he has no mother!</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> It would not interest you, madam, to learn all these
details; but please to remember that you are not my friend
George, and that I’ve not absolutely gone on my knees to
you to read my letter.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> (<i>aside, looking at</i> <span class='sc'>Charles</span>). Just imagine if it were
him! (<i>Rising with animation.</i>) Well, sir, I don’t repent of
having read your letter: in fact, I congratulate myself on
having done so; and I am also glad to see you here, for now
I can implore you, beseech you, to renounce such fatal plans;
to beg of you with clasped hands to do so, in the name of
your mother.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> Madam!</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> Listen, sir. I cannot explain to you my object in
being so curious; but what is your name?</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> Charleston King.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> Sir!</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> That is my veil. If you want to take it off, remove
your own.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> No, sir: that is impossible; but—</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> In that case, madam, I am Charleston King, too
lazy to do any thing, but quite at your service.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span><i>Luc.</i> (<i>aside</i>). What shall I do? (<i>Looking round, sees
flowers.</i>) Ah! (<i>Takes a sprig of May, and comes towards</i>
<span class='sc'>Cha.</span>) Sir, we are about to part, probably never to meet
again; would it be repugnant to your feelings to accept a
souvenir?</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> Pardon, madam, but you don’t propose giving me a
dressing-case?</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> Don’t be alarmed. The souvenir I give you, do
you promise to keep it?</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> For ever, madam, I swear it. (<i>Aside.</i>) What can
it be?</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> (<i>kissing sprig, and leaning against back of</i> <span class='sc'>Cha.’s</span>
<i>chair</i>). Take it.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> (<i>looking at it, but not taking it</i>). A sprig of May!</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> Upon which I have just left a kiss. (<span class='sc'>Cha.</span> <i>moves</i>.)
You have sworn never to part with it. Good! Should you
persist in your fatal project, at the moment when you are
about to commit this frightful act, perhaps my poor little
sprig may catch your eye; perhaps it will remind you of the
days of your childhood, those happy days that have fled
away; those Sundays when your mother’s smile was upon
you as you filled your little arms with flowers, and brought
your childish offering to her knees.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> Keep still, my heart!</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> If you should have such thoughts, your courage
will be tried; for, in speaking to you of me, my little sprig
will also remind you of your mother; and if you should
still desire—</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> (<i>seizing sprig</i>). No, no! I have no longer any such
desire (<i>seizing her hand, and kissing it, slides upon his knees</i>).
I swear it to you on my knees. But I must see the angel
who—(<i>Lifts his head, when</i> <span class='sc'>Lucy</span> <i>turns away</i>). Ah,
cruel! This hand at least I hold.</p>

<div class='c007'>[<i>Covers it with kisses.</i></div>
<p class='c011'><i>Luc.</i> Give me my hand, sir, or else—</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> Or else—</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> Tell me your name.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> Shall I see your face?</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> No, no! I cannot possibly—</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> Madam, I implore you! I beseech you!</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Eliz.</i> (<i>outside</i>). It’s me, mam. There’s no key.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> Elizabeth!—Get up at once, and return to your
room, I implore you!</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span><i>Cha.</i> Madam, I obey you; but—</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> (<i>going towards door</i>). Thanks, sir, and don’t forget
my lecture.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> (<i>entering his room</i>). In thinking of you, madam, I
shall always remember it.</p>

<div class='c007'>[<i>Exit.</i> <span class='sc'>Lucy</span> <i>opens door</i>.</div>
<p class='c011'><i>Eliz.</i> (<i>entering</i> <span class='fss'>2 E. L.</span>). Why, the key’s fallen out. (<i>Aside.</i>)
She’s been up to something, I know.</p>

<div class='c007'>[<i>Replaces it.</i></div>
<p class='c011'><i>Luc.</i> (<i>still upset</i>). You must be tired, Elizabeth. Go to
bed, my good girl, go.</p>

<div class='c007'>[<i>Reseats herself, and takes up book.</i></div>
<p class='c011'><i>Eliz.</i> (<i>takes off tea things</i>). I tired! Oh, no, mum!
(<i>Returns.</i>) Surely thirty waltzes or quadrilles wouldn’t tire
me much; and there’s only two hours to sleep. It’s not
worth while going to bed: so, if you please, mum, I’ll sit
up with you.</p>

<div class='c007'>[<i>Sits on sofa.</i></div>
<p class='c011'><i>Luc.</i> It must, then, be that nephew, the son of his sister,
of whom Mr. Mortimer always avoided speaking to me.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> (<i>in next room, uneasy</i>). What on earth made her so
anxious to know my name?</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> At any rate, I have his promise: that’s some consolation.
By the way, Elizabeth, did you know Mr. Mortimer’s
nephew?</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Eliz.</i> Well, yes,—little Charley Devereux. Oh, yes! I
recollect; and I—I—(<i>falling asleep and dreaming</i>) thank
you, sir: I don’t dance any more.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> And to think she’ll leave without my seeing her
face! It’s abominable!</p>

<div class='c007'>[<i>Rises.</i></div>
<p class='c011'><i>Luc.</i> (<i>Looking at</i> <span class='sc'>Elizabeth</span>). She’s asleep, poor thing!
She’ll catch cold.</p>

<div class='c007'>[<i>Covers her with her cloak.</i></div>
<p class='c011'><i>Cha.</i> Ah, this window! Perhaps there’s a veranda.</p>

<div class='c007'>[<i>Goes to window.</i></div>
<p class='c011'><i>Luc.</i> How can I ascertain for certain that he is Mr. Mortimer’s
nephew? I must know it somehow.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> No road here; perhaps by the other staircase. I
shall just go in without knocking, as if I had forgotten;
that’s it: here goes.</p>

<div class='c007'>[<i>Exit, slamming door.</i></div>
<p class='c011'><i>Luc.</i> That noise was in his room. I think he’s gone out.
If I was certain that dressing-case he spoke of would tell
me! (<i>At door.</i>) Sir, Mr. King! No answer. What have
I to fear?</p>

<div class='c007'>[<i>Enters room, closing door.</i></div>
<p class='c011'><i>Cha.</i> (<i>gently opening</i> <span class='fss'>2 E. L.</span> <i>door</i>). Yes, this is the room.
(<i>Looking round.</i>) She sleeps; my handkerchief too. Now,
my charming girl, let me see your face. (<i>Takes candle,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>starts back.</i>) Confound it! Well, there’s the end of my
dream.</p>

<div class='c007'>[<i>Heaves a sigh, and goes out.</i></div>
<p class='c011'><i>Eliz.</i> (<i>starting up</i>). There’s somebody in the room. (<i>Goes
to door at back, and looks in.</i>) I knew she was up to something:
I’ll find it out, see if I don’t.</p>

<div class='c007'>[<i>Exit</i> <span class='fss'>1 L. E.</span></div>
<p class='c011'><i>Luc.</i> (<i>searching</i>). Ah, here it is at last,—Charles Devereux.
It’s he, it’s he! (<i>She returns hastily, and bolts door.</i>)
Ah, how my heart beats! what shall I do now? (<i>Thinking.</i>)
The fact is, he’s very nice, notwithstanding his nickname.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> (<i>entering, and falling into arm-chair</i>). Another
dream, that takes itself off to the land of dreams. (<i>Striking
table.</i>) No, it’s always the same. If you were to go to
a masked ball where there was only one woman—oh, love!
oh, frenzy! the mask falls, ugh! no more love, no more
frenzy. The woman’s ninety, and ugly as—heaven knows
what.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> He’s come in. (<i>Calling at door.</i>) Mr. King!</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> And such a voice!</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> Sir.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> Woke her up, I suppose. Madam—</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> Sir, I should like to have a few words of explanation
with you.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> (<i>running to fasten door</i>). Oh, by jingo!</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> He’s locked himself in. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Pardon me, sir,
for troubling you; but—but—if I mistake not, you are
Mr. Charles Devereux, the nephew of Mr. Mortimer.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> I suppose you mean, madam, that that gentleman
was my uncle. I don’t dispute the fact. (<i>Aside.</i>) How the
mischief did she find that out? Ah! it’s that confounded
landlord told her.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> Well, sir, I’ve a most important communication to
make to you from his adopted child.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> But I don’t want to hear what she’s got to say,
madam. You know her?</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> Yes, sir, I know her; and I also know that she has
been seeking you for a long time, in order to give you up a
fortune which by right belongs to you.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> What you propose, madam, is ridiculous. I could
never accept a farthing.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> But suppose in seeing her you happen to like her,
and that—</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> I shall never like her.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span><i>Luc.</i> Perhaps you might. If she were like me, for
instance?</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> Never, madam. I’m sworn celibacy,—a knight of
Malta, in fact.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> (<i>aside</i>). What an extraordinary change! (<i>Aloud.</i>)
Mr. King, I’m in the greatest danger, and you alone can
save me.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> Madam, I’ve saved you twice to-night, and I distinctly
refuse to do it any more.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> (<i>aside</i>). He’s absolutely getting impertinent. Sir, I
have something to return to you that belongs to you,—a
pocket-handkerchief.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> Thanks: I’ve got it,—one with a monogram. I
really believe I must barricade my door.</p>

<div class='c007'>[<i>Puts furniture against door.</i></div>
<p class='c011'><i>Luc.</i> He’s got it! Why, he must have come in here,
then; and—and—of course he saw Elizabeth with my
cloak round her. I see. Ha, ha, ha!</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> Confound her, she’s laughing! She laughs too as
if she was only twenty.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> So, sir, you refuse to open the door?</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> Quite impossible, madam. I’m gone, I’m a long
way off, I’m on my road to Baden.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> Pleasant journey, sir. (<i>Aside.</i>) It can’t be helped,
I must have recourse to more violent means.</p>

<div class='c007'>[<i>Exit</i> <span class='fss'>L. D.</span></div>
<p class='c011'><i>Cha.</i> I verily believe she’s going to burst the door in:
I’d better bolt. The devil! this is becoming serious. It
almost reminds me of my adventure amongst the savages in
Africa, where the daughter of a king, with rings in her nose,
took a violent fancy to me. The king favored the marriage,
and told me quietly that I had the choice, if I didn’t marry
his daughter he’d eat me. I at once answered, “Your Majesty,
I prefer to enter your family to your mouth; I’ll marry
your daughter to-morrow.” And during the night I escaped
to the coast. Let us do the same, and escape to the coast.</p>

<div class='c007'>[<i>Makes for door.</i></div>
<p class='c011'><i>Pri.</i> (<i>appearing at door drunk</i>). Miss Lucy Mortimer
wishes to have the honor of seeing you, sir.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> Miss who, did you say?</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Pri.</i> Well, sir, beg pardon, it’s your cousin’s uncle or
your uncle’s cousin.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> Ask the lady to walk in, wretched man.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span><i>Pri.</i> (<i>announcing</i> <span class='sc'>Lucy</span>, <i>who is in</i> <span class='sc'>Elizabeth’s</span> <i>cloak

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> (<i>speaking to him in a disguised voice, and throwing
back veil</i>). Well, sir, what do you think of me?</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> Ah, madam! Even the most confused man in the
world could but confess that you are charming. (<i>Aside.</i>) If
my neighbor were only half as pretty! Charming is not the
word; but, excuse me, you come here at five in the morning,
and ask me what I think of you. Well, that’s all right, I
suppose; but pardon me if I go further, and venture to ask
in the most humble manner in the world a little question.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> (<i>same voice</i>). I’m listening.</p>

(<i>Points to dressing-case.</i>) Because it’s the name of a kind,
frank, brave young fellow, whom I really don’t find too lazy

your name.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Cha.</i> Why, it’s like a dream. But your husband,

retain the fortune that so justly belongs to you.</p>

<p class='c003'><i>Luc.</i> Ah, if you refuse me, I shall ask you to give me
back my sprig of May.</p>

of my life, and with it the hand I now hold.</p>

is one from which we are both of us suffering, and it is one
that has but one remedy for its cure. (<i>To audience.</i>) Dear
friends, the malady is love: the remedy is marriage. If
any of you are suffering from some of the premonitory
symptoms of this insidious disease, you will, I feel sure,
accord us your utmost sympathy. But if there should be
any here who have not yet been attacked, and who wish to
avoid contagion, let me strongly recommend them to avoid,
upon any pretence whatever, a conversation with a lady
which is to be carried on</p>

<p class='c003'>“We have many readers and books that purport to furnish pieces for the use
of amateur speakers and juvenile orators. But the great defect in nearly all of
them is, that their selections are made from the same series of authors. We are
surfeited <i>ad nauseam</i> with ‘The boy stood on the burning deck,’ ‘On Linden,
when the sun was low,’ ‘My name is Norval!’ or, ‘My voice is still for war.’
But in this volume, the first of a series, Mr. Baker deviates from the beaten
track, and furnishes some fifty selections which have not been published before
in any collection of readings. Mr. Baker has himself written many pieces for the
amateur stage, and achieved a reputation as a public reader, so that he is eminently
qualified by his own experience for the task of teaching others.”—<i>Phil. Age.</i></p>

endeavors in the field of light and agreeable literature. The selections are made
with good taste, and the book will be of great value for its indicated purpose.”—<i>New
Haven Courier.</i></p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
